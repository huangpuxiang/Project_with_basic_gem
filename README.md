    when you build a new project,you need to install some gems,
which wastes much time, so i build a blank project with following gems:
1、bootstrap-sass
2、devise
3、simple_form

besides, I implement function of flash, if "flash[:notice] = 'xxx'"" exits in controller,
the alert infomation would occur in the view.
